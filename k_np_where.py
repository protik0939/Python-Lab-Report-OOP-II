# Scenario: You’re analyzing temperatures recorded over several days. You want to identify days
# when the temperature exceeded a certain threshold and replace any low temperatures with a
# specified minimum value.
#---------------------------
# Question:
# Given a NumPy array of temperatures, write code to:
# ● Use np.where to find indices where the temperature exceeds a certain threshold.
# ● Use np.where to replace temperatures below a certain threshold with a minimum
# value.
# Demonstrate this operation with a sample temperature array.
#---------------------------
# Answer:
#---------------------------
